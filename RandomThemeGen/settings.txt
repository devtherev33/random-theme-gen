in space
underwater
inside a volcano
on a giant duck
in a haunted mall
during a bread apocalypse
in a dream
in the clouds
at the bottom of the ocean
on a floating island
in a cyberpunk city
in prehistoric times
on Mars
inside a computer
in a parallel dimension
in a living forest
in a pocket universe
in a glitchy simulation
inside a vending machine
inside a massive library
in a city made of cheese
inside a sleeping whale
on top of a moving train
in an abandoned amusement park
in a rogue AI's mind
in a forgotten temple
inside a time loop
in a reverse-world
on a spaceship with no gravity
inside a magic school
on a soap bubble
in the belly of a dragon
on a couch that’s a portal
inside a duck pond
in an infinite IKEA
in a never-ending carnival
in a world made of cardboard
on a sinking boat
inside a forgotten fridge
in a castle made of spaghetti
inside a toaster
in a land of talking plants
on a pizza planet
in a backyard jungle
inside a bubblegum factory
on an island shaped like a goose
in a post-apocalyptic zoo
in a floating junkyard
on the moon during a party
in a simulation gone wrong
in the stomach of a cosmic cat
on an asteroid shaped like bread
inside a sandcastle kingdom
in a giant's sock drawer
in a cursed arcade
inside a broken VR headset
in a time-frozen snowglobe
in a duck’s daydream
on a floating library of dreams
inside a pancake dimension
in a wormhole café
inside a malfunctioning duckbot
on a raft drifting through space
in a secret underwater bakery
on a flying toaster oven
in a pocket-sized medieval town
in a 404 error screen
inside your own reflection
on a cloud shaped like a throne
in a disco-themed volcano
in a room with infinite doors
inside a thunderstorm
inside a world of reversed gravity
in a place where shadows are alive
in a parallel duck universe
in a swamp of sentient noodles
inside a duck museum
on a boat captained by bread
inside a forbidden corn maze
in a dream where time stands still
on the edge of reality
inside a banana republic
in a world powered by memes
in a cosmic bathtub
in a haunted sock factory
inside a microwave kingdom
on a trampoline planet
in a cardboard city
inside a spaceship's glovebox
in a digital aquarium
on a sky train that never stops
inside an ancient rubber duck temple
in a giant cereal bowl
in a town where it’s always Halloween
inside a haunted lunchbox
on a lava surfing resort
in a land ruled by ducks
