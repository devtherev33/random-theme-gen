but gravity is reversed
and everyone’s a robot
with no colors allowed
where time only moves when you move
but you control everything by shouting
with zero textures
where all characters are made of jelly
and ducks are your only weapon
but the floor is literally lava
and you're invisible
but you age in reverse
and every second changes the laws of physics
but the main character is toast
and you're being chased by a goose
with only one button to play
but you can’t stop bouncing
where sound is your only guide
but your inventory slowly deletes itself
and your character lies to you constantly
but you can only move diagonally
with randomized controls
where your enemies are your past selves
and reality keeps glitching out
but you swap bodies every 10 seconds
and you're being livestreamed by aliens
where the map is different every minute
but you can only see one pixel at a time
and the game insults you when you fail
but everyone speaks in rhymes
and your weapons are made of spaghetti
but your health is your Wi-Fi signal
and the boss is a sentient refrigerator
but you’re blindfolded
and ducks give you missions
but your only ally is a piece of sentient bread
where sneezing causes explosions
and your voice is the menu
but time goes backwards on Wednesdays
and everything is upside down
but you’re stuck in a musical
with a random duck companion who betrays you
but you can't jump unless you're crying
and you trade lives with NPCs constantly
but every enemy is controlled by real people
and you glitch every 30 seconds
but your abilities are random each day
and the rules change mid-game
but the game gets harder if you stop moving
and the walls tell jokes to distract you
but you're being judged by intergalactic critics
and your controls are linked to a real-life weather API
but you start each level as a different creature
and time slows down when you blink
but you have to draw your own weapons
and your footsteps leave portals
but your health bar is a duck’s mood
where all the music is backwards
but your character can’t stop spinning
and pausing causes a boss fight
but physics are written in haiku
and your game saves are haunted
but your character can’t remember anything
and you must barter using bread
but you gain power from bad puns
and the world shrinks every minute
but explosions heal you
where all dialogue is sung opera-style
and your stats are randomized hourly
but your powers depend on the phase of the moon
and time resets when you sneeze
but you're allergic to everything
and your weapon is a rubber duck that quacks loudly
but the laws of physics roll a dice every 5 seconds
and everything is made of rubber
but your shadow runs away from you
and every button press spawns a goose
but the floor randomly disappears
and you’re haunted by your own tutorials
but you’re always sliding uncontrollably
and your health is determined by how cool your hat is
but your memories are in reverse order
and your pet duck is the villain
but the main mechanic is interpretive dance
and the minimap lies to you
but the camera has a mind of its own
and checkpoints randomly explode
